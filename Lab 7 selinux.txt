MCS labels so that:

->file1 has category c0
->file2 has category c1
->A user/process with s0:c0 can only access file1
->A user/process with s0:c1 can only access file2

 Step-by-Step Lab (on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora)



1 Check SELinux status


getenforce

# Should be: Enforcing


 2. Create the test files


sudo touch /tmp/file1 /tmp/file2


 3. See current labels


ls -Z /tmp/file1 /tmp/file2



system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0


 4. Assign MCS categories

->file1 → s0:c0
->file2 → s0:c1


sudo chcon -l s0:c0 /tmp/file1
sudo chcon -l s0:c1 /tmp/file2


 5. Verify labels


ls -Z /tmp/file*



system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0:c0 /tmp/file1
system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0:c1 /tmp/file2
