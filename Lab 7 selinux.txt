MCS labels so that:

->`file1` has category `c0`
->`file2` has category `c1`
->A user/process with `s0:c0` can only access file1
->A user/process with `s0:c1` can only access file2

getenforce

# Should be: Enforcing

---# 2.= Create the test files


sudo touch /tmp/file1 /tmp/file2


---

---# 3. See current labels


ls -Z /tmp/file1 /tmp/file2


Youâ€™ll see default like:


system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0

---# 4. Assign MCS categories

->`file1` â†’ `s0:c0`
->`file2` â†’ `s0:c1`


sudo chcon -l s0:c0 /tmp/file1
sudo chcon -l s0:c1 /tmp/file2


---

---# 5. Verify labels


ls -Z /tmp/file*


Should show something like:


system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0:c0 /tmp/file1
system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0:c1 /tmp/file2
